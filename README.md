# Approach to the product:
- I did a quick sketch on what the UI would look like and the features that would be impemented and then decided to make use of the coordinator pattern to navigate the views that would be displayed. 
- The coordinator pattern is responsible for the app flow. It creates, configures, display and dismisses different view controllers without having to         instantiate another view controller within itself..
